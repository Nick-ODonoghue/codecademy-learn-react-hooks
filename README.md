## Sticking Points & What I learned

useState & useEffect

- tbh I wasn't 100% happy with how this course tried to teach the subject. Despite going back over the course and creating my notes I still feel I have a lot to learn. So I will look for guides elsewhere to help cement logic and missing pieces together.
